# Birthday game for my bf
He's not a "stuff" guy but he likes Suduko and mind puzzles so I made this game for him that will lead him to his actual present which is a Rubiks cube.

The scene is our appartment.
When you walk up to the table a popup shows with a text that is encrypted.
I used a vigenere chiffer to encrypt the text, it's a riddle saying "We come from the same source but I am not your reflection, who am I?"
To decrypt the text you have to find the key phrase.
When you walk up to the second table you come to the puzzle and in the puzzle the word "love" is hidden which is the key phrase for the chiffer and also a clue for where he needs to go later.
Some other clues are:
- Walking up to the tv it tells you about Blaise de Vigen√®re
- The heart balloon and the painting with the bridge on the wall.

The answer to the riddle is "sister" which indicates that he needs to go see his sister. I gave his sister keys that she gave to him, the keys go to a padlock I put on our towns "love bridge",
on the padlock I painted a Pokemon ball (we play a lot of Pokemon Go), he opens Pokemon Go and sees a route that says "Ahris favourite" which leads him to go talk to Ahri.
Walking up to Ahri wakes her up and she asks you what your favourite activity is and can give you 3 different answers
- Pokemon Go = Pokemon Go is fun, we explore a lot then!
- Wobble = Wobble bowl is my favourite too!!
- Swimming = Bathing in the ocean is fun, but I'm too afraid of swimming...

We have a box at home where all the dogs toys are, including the wobble bowl, in the box he finds the real present hidden.
